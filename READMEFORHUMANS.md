This is a tool I made for easy STT when I'm working using remote inference.
It's designed to be VERY simple, it has effectively no gui, but does tell you state using system notifications.
I suggest binding the command to your keyboard or mouse, so eg. for me when I click META + O in hyprland it will start recording.
This means it can also be bound to anything, I also have it bound to my gaming mouse for when I'm feeling really lazy, and you could bind it to a footpedal.
Upon getting the notification your transcription is complete, what you said will be in your clipboard.
I vibe coded this, there may be bugs and edge cases, but it works when I use the main functionality.
Happy talking.
